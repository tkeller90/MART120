        Here lies my completed tasks while I journeyed through Creative Coding I. 
        First, we aquainted ourselves with GitHub, where we would be uploading our projects and have the ability to share them here now with others.
    The first coding language we made symbols with Code.org.<br>

Back in Code.org we made a Play Lab game. <br>

<br>
I made the start of the book The Little Prince with our next project.<br>

I really enjoyed learning about Randy Pausch and the Alice Project. Randy was born around the same year as my parents, and he kind of looks like my dad. I think his lecture and his advice on achieving your childhood dreams was sweet and so spot on. It's the kind of lessons every child could use from their father. So, I can not embed my Alice project here. It can be found and loaded if you want to pursue it below.<br>

In the middle of the semester, over the course of a few weeks we worked with html. First making really basic pages, then adding more and more over the weeks. Here are the final pages that I made. <br>

The last coding language we worked with was p5.js and javascript. This was complicated at first, but I started getting the hang of it after awhile. It's pictorial with a self portrait ;) and we got things moving at first.

<br>
We made a little game with logical operators.<br>

<br>
<a href="https://tkeller90.github.io/MART120/Homework%2013/HW13.html" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Game</a>
<br>
Then we added some functions to the game.<br>
<a href="https://tkeller90.github.io/MART120/Homework%2014/HW14.html" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Functions</a>
<br>
Last, we did arrays!<br>

Thank you for a great semester, Michael! I really learned a lot and enjoyed your class. Thank you for your patience and understanding!

Best,<br>
