            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>My name is Tegan Keller. I am an art student at the University of Montana. I am studying as a distance learner while I live and raise my two elementary school aged children. </p>
            <p>I am excited to learn and become more fluent in another coding language. They all seem to over lap in ways. I'm not sure how often I will build from scratch like this. I sure see the value of being able to understand editing builds.</p>
