            <h1>Toss a coin to your witcher!!</h1>
            <p>When a humble bard<br>
Graced a ride along<br>
With Geralt of Rivia<br>
Along came this song</p>
<p>From when the White Wolf fought<br>
A silver-tongued devil<br>
His army of elves<br>
At his hooves did they revel</p>


<p>They came after me<br>
With masterful deceit<br>
Broke down my lute<br>
And they kicked in my teeth</p>


<p>While the devil's horns<br>
Minced our tender meat<br>
And so cried the Witcher<br>
He can't be bleat</p>


<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh<br>
Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty</p>


<p>At the edge of the world<br>
Fight the mighty horde<br>
That bashes and breaks you<br>
And brings you to mourn</p>


<p>He thrust every elf<br>
Far back on the shelf<br>
High up on the mountain<br>
From whence it came</p>


<p>He wiped out your pest<br>
Got kicked in his chest<br>
He's a friend of humanity<br>
So give him the rest</p>


<p>That's my epic tale<br>
Our champion prevailed<br>
Defeated the villain<br>
Now pour him some ale</p>


<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh<br>
Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
A friend of humanity<br>
Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh<br>
Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
A friend of humanity<br>
Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty<br>
Oh, Valley of Plenty, ah-ah, oh<br>
Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
A friend of humanity<br>
