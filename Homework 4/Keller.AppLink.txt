I could've kept going with this and I want to revisit this again. I am trying to put together the points of the book "The Little Prince." It's my son's favorite and he loves video games as well. I thought this might be a neat way of visualizing and interacting with story books for my kids.

Edit: OKAY! I believe I figured out my issue with the link and now my new link is good to go! I made my app in the lesson and used the link for it, but I guess it was dead or something? I had the time this morning to remake it in a new project and made a few improvements in my try. Losing a project is just a second chance to learn and make it better. I still want to expand with the rest of the book. 


And here is my game link I was missing.
